# The Talls Blog
This is the repo for the Talls blog. Initially based on a guide from [Joy of Code](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-markdown-blog), this is an open-ended project to refresh myself on SvelteKit web development. 

I plan on making significant changes from the guide. For instance, I plan to convert the styling to Tailwind where possible, as well as general aesthetic/theme changes
